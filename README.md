# PCA and Logistic Regression on Cancer Dataset
This project demonstrates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction on the breast cancer dataset, followed by Logistic Regression to classify the data based on the reduced components.

## Requirements
To set up the environment, ensure you have the following packages installed:

`numpy`

`pandas`

`matplotlib`

`scikit-learn`

**To install the required packages, run:**

`pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn`

## Running the Project
Clone the repository.
Open the PCACancer.ipynb

## Output
- **PCA Plot:** A scatter plot showing the two principal components.

- **Logistic Regression Results:** Accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

- **Confusion Matrix Plot:** A visualization of the confusion matrix for the Logistic Regression model.
